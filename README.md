This is repository for my lightweight C++ async library for embedded Linux devices or Linux services on x86/ARM boxes, based on libasio and zeromq.
I hope someone will help to improve this lib.)

Purpose of creating is simple, it's good to have an extremely lightwight library (ideally header only) for different projects related to embedded Linux devices for non critical automatization etc.

This library is intended to be C++14 compliant (most of projects I work on are supposed to use GCC 6 or Clang-9 compilers)
